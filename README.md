# Adoption-of-AI-Based-Draw-and-Learn-tool-for-Vocabulary-Development-in-School-Students
Our goal is to leverage cu  ing-edge AI to enable primary school students to learn English and Telugu vocabulary by drawing, receiving real-time feedback, and continuously improving the learning experience through intelligent systems.
The Core Challenge for AI:
At its heart, this project is about building a robust and adaptive hand-drawn image
recognition system that can scale to a large vocabulary (targeting 1500-2000+ words), adapt
to diverse drawing styles from young learners (primary school students up to Class 5), and
continuously improve its accuracy based on real-world usage and expert feedback. We are
inspired by applications like Google's Quick Draw, but aim to signi

cantly expand its
vocabulary and tailor it for an India-centric educational context, focusing on English and
Telugu.
Core AI Functionalities: What You Will Build and Optimize
Your role as an AI Engineer will be central to developing the intelligence that powers
this learning tool. Here are the key AI functionalities you will be responsible for:
1. AI-Powered Drawing Recognition Engine:
○ Task: The primary function is to accurately classify a student's hand-drawn
sketch into one of the target vocabulary words. This is fundamentally an
image classi

cation problem. The system will present a word (e.g., "apple"

or "
స
కం" - book) to the student, and they will draw the corresponding
image. Your model needs to identify what they drew.
○ Examples:
■ Scenario 1 (Successful Recognition):
■ System prompts: "Draw an Apple"
■ Student draws: A roughly circular shape with a small stem and leaf.
■ AI Recognition: High con

dence match to "apple".

■ System Response: "That looks like a perfect Apple!" (or equivalent in
Telugu).
■ Scenario 2 (Uncertain Recognition):
■ System prompts: "Draw a Car"
■ Student draws: A boxy shape with four circles at the bo

om, but no

clear windows or doors.
■ AI Recognition: Moderate con

dence, perhaps suggesting "bus" or

"train" as alternatives, but also having a plausible score for "car".
■ System Response: "Hmm, I'm not sure, does it have doors?" or "That
looks a bit like a bus, but could it be a car?" (Prompting for
clari
cation or suggesting key features).
■ Scenario 3 (Incorrect Recognition):
■ System prompts: "Draw a Dog"
■ Student draws: Something that clearly resembles a cat.
■ AI Recognition: High con

dence match to "cat", low con

dence for

"dog".
■ System Response: "That looks like a Cat! Can you try drawing a Dog?"
(Providing the correct word and prompting another a
empt).

○ Con
dence-Based Feedback: You will implement logic to provide feedback
based on the AI model's output probabilities or con

dence scores for

di
erent classes.

2. Enhanced Drawing Interactions:
○ Color-Fill Feature:
■ Task: The AI needs to assist in the color-

lling process. This requires the
system to understand the boundaries of drawn shapes, even if the lines
are not perfectly closed. When a student a

empts to

ll a region with
color, the AI should ideally detect the intended enclosed area to contain
the
ll. This involves techniques related to image segmentation, contour
detection, or graph-based image processing to identify connected
components and boundaries within the sketch.
■ Example: A student draws the outline of a

ower with petals, but there's a
small gap between two petals. When the student tries to color one petal,
the AI should prevent the color from "leaking" out through the gap and
lling the entire background.
○ Complete-the-Drawing Tasks:
■ Task: The system provides a partial outline of an object, and the student
completes it. The AI needs to recognize the initial partial shape and then
evaluate if the student's additions successfully complete the intended
object. This is more complex than simple classi

cation and might involve
object detection on incomplete shapes, keypoint detection, or shape
matching algorithms to compare the completed drawing against
expected pa

erns for the target word.

■ Example: The system displays a partial drawing of a bicycle frame and
wheels. The student adds handlebars, a seat, and pedals. The AI should
analyze the combined drawing and con

rm that it now represents a

complete "bicycle."

3. AI-Based Hints (Gami

ed Learning Experience):

○ Task: Generate intelligent, context-aware clues or prompts to guide students
who are struggling with a drawing. This could involve analyzing why the
current drawing is not being recognized and suggesting speci

c features to
add or modify. This might require analyzing feature maps from your CNN or
developing a separate rule-based or simpler ML model trained on common
drawing errors.
○ Example: If a student is repeatedly drawing a circle when prompted for "sun,"
the AI might suggest: "Try adding some lines around the circle for rays!" Or if
drawing a "house" without a roof: "Houses usually have a roof on top!"
4. Inappropriate Content Guardrails:
○ Task: Implement a system to detect and

ag or block drawings that are

potentially o

ensive or inappropriate. This is a form of image classi
cation

focused on a speci

c, sensitive set of categories.

○ Example: If a student draws a shape that is known to be an inappropriate
symbol or

gure, the AI should detect this.

○ Mechanism: This could involve training a separate classi

cation model on a
dataset of inappropriate images, or using pre-trained models available for
content moderation. A critical component is the teacher override
mechanism to correct false positives or missed content.

AI Methodology & Lifecycle: How We Plan to Build & Evolve
Your work will span the entire AI lifecycle, from initial model training to continuous
deployment and improvement.
1. Initial Model Development & Training:
○ Provided Dataset is Key: We want to emphasize that a substantial initial
dataset of hand-drawn images is provided for your immediate use. This
dataset contains examples across the initial target vocabulary (1500-2000+
words). This is a signi

cant head start, meaning you won't need to embark on

extensive data collection from scratch for the foundational model.
○ Your Role: Your initial focus will be on:
■ Data Preprocessing & Augmentation: Cleaning, normalizing, resizing,
and augmenting the provided dataset (e.g., rotations, scaling, adding
noise) to enhance model robustness and generalize be

er to unseen

student drawings.

■ Model Selection & Architecture Design: Choosing and potentially
customizing CNN architectures (ResNet, Inception, MobileNet) that are
best suited for this speci

c dataset and the need for both accuracy and

e
ciency.
■ Initial Training: Training the selected model(s) on the preprocessed and
augmented provided dataset.
■ Evaluation & Benchmarking: Rigorously evaluating the performance of
the initial model on a held-out test set from the provided data,
establishing baseline accuracy and latency metrics.

2. Continuous Training & Reinforcement Learning Loop: This is a critical and
unique aspect of the project that drives long-term improvement.
○ Data Sources: The continuous learning loop is fueled by two main sources of
new data:
■ Student Sketches & Usage Data: Drawings created by students during
their learning sessions.
■ Teacher Feedback: Real-time con

rmations or corrections provided by

teachers on the AI's recognition of student drawings.
■ Teacher Reference Samples: New, high-quality reference drawings
contributed by teachers for speci

c words.

○ Feedback Capture Pipeline: You will design the data pipeline to capture
real-time teacher feedback e

ciently. When a teacher con

rms or corrects a
drawing's label, this feedback (linking the drawing, the AI's prediction, and the
teacher's correct label) is timestamped and ingested.
○ Automated Retraining: You will set up automated, periodic retraining
schedules for the AI model. These retraining cycles will:
■ Combine the initial provided dataset with all newly collected data (student
drawings, teacher feedback, teacher reference samples) since the last
training cycle.
■ Retrain the model on this expanded and updated dataset.
■ Evaluate the newly trained model's performance.
■ If the new model shows improvement (e.g., higher accuracy, be
er

handling of previously misclassi

ed drawings), it will be deployed to

replace the current production model.
○ Reinforcement Example: Suppose the initial model struggles to distinguish
between drawings of "cat" and "tiger" based on the provided dataset. As
students draw and teachers provide feedback (correcting "tiger" misclassi
ed
as "cat," and vice versa), these new labeled examples are added to the
training pool. In the next retraining cycle, the model learns from these speci
c

examples, improving its ability to di

erentiate between the two.

3. Cloud-Based Architecture & MLOps:
○ Scalability: The solution needs to be scalable across potentially thousands of
schools in Telangana. You will leverage a cloud-based architecture (e.g., GCP,
AWS, Azure) for both model training and inference. This ensures high
availability and e

cient resource utilization, especially given that model
inference will be "primarily done via cloud to accommodate older or shared
devices."
○ MLOps Pipeline: You will be responsible for se

ing up and maintaining robust

MLOps pipelines. This includes automated processes for:
■ Data Versioning & Management: Managing versions of both the initial
provided dataset and the continuously growing new data.
■ Data Ingestion & Preprocessing: Building pipelines to process the
continuous stream of new data and prepare it for retraining.
■ Model Training Orchestration: Automating the execution of training jobs
on the cloud infrastructure.
■ Model Versioning & Registry: Maintaining a registry of di

erent model

versions and their performance metrics.
■ Automated Model Deployment: Implementing strategies (e.g.,
blue/green deployment, canary releases) to deploy new, improved models
to production inference endpoints with minimal downtime.
■ Continuous Model Monitoring: Se

ing up dashboards and alerts to
track model performance in production (accuracy, latency, error rates)
and using these metrics to trigger retraining cycles when necessary
(performance-based triggers).
Key AI Challenges & Considerations:
● Data Diversity: While an initial dataset is provided, ongoing challenges will
include managing the diversity of hand-drawn images from various age groups,
di
erent schools, and cultural contexts within Telangana, ensuring the model
doesn't develop biases towards speci

c drawing styles or interpretations.
● Language Neutrality: The AI must perform uniformly well for both English and
Telugu vocabulary. This requires careful consideration during data preparation
(ensuring balanced representation of drawings associated with words in both
languages) and potentially in model architecture or training strategies to avoid
language-speci

c biases.

● Real-time Performance: The interactive nature of the tool demands low-latency
inference. Students need quick feedback. Balancing model complexity (for
accuracy) with inference speed will be a key challenge, especially when serving
potentially thousands of students concurrently via the cloud.

● Low Hardware Footprint / O

ine Capability: While cloud inference is primary,
the requirement for usability in low-connectivity environments means exploring
options for e

cient, potentially quantized or smaller models that could run on

devices for basic o

ine recognition, syncing data later.

● Ethical AI: Strict adherence to data privacy (anonymization of student drawings
and data) and ensuring the ethical use of teacher feedback solely for model
improvement are paramount. Building trust with educators regarding how their
input is used is essential.
● Interpretability (Optional but valuable): While not a hard requirement, gaining
some level of understanding of why the model makes certain predictions could be
bene
cial for generating be

er hints or debugging misclassi
cation.

We are excited about the potential of this project to signi

cantly impact early

education by making vocabulary learning more e

ective and enjoyable. If you are an
AI Engineer passionate about computer vision, deep learning, MLOps, and building
intelligent systems that leverage real-world feedback to continuously learn and
improve, and if you are excited by the challenge of applying AI in a high-impact
educational context, we encourage you to explore this opportunity and detail your
approach.
